## Introduction
> The homework document is here as a reference. I suspect that as the semester progresses, things in the actual homework codebase will change. If you notice a discrepency between the homework doc and the comments/code in the assignment, please let me know.

In this assignment, you will make an infinite scroller game using the Typescript programming language and the Wolfie2D game engine. By completing this assignment, you should start to become familiar with the Wolfie2D game engine and develop an understanding of:

* How to receive and respond to game events use Wolfie2D's EventQueue
* Deal with simple collision detection
* Load sprites and animated sprites in Wolfie2D
* Define a custom shader in Wolfie2D
* Record and replay games in Wofie2D
* Set random numbers/seeds in Wolfie2D

## Getting Started
First, you'll need to clone the base code in this repository. After you've cloned the base code, run `npm install`. Once the node modules have installed, run `gulp` to transpile the hw2 base code. 

## Codebase Files
The structure of the hw2 codebase looks similar to the tree diagram shown below.

Most of the work you'll be doing for homework 2 is in the `hw2` folder. You'll also have to work with the some shader code. The shader files for homework 2 are under `hw2_assets/shaders`.

## Codebase Structure
In general, the infinite scroller game for hw2 has a structure similar to the diagram shown below. The scene manages several collections of actors/objects (lasers, bubbles, mines, etc.) and each of those actors has some behavior (AI component) associated with. 
```mermaid
classDiagram 
    
    class HW2Scene
    HW2Scene : #Array~AnimatedSprite~ mines
    HW2Scene : #Array~Graphic~ bubbles
    HW2Scene : #Array~Graphic~ lasers
    HW2Scene : #AnimatedSprite player
 
    PlayerActor "1" --> HW2Scene
    PlayerController "1" --> PlayerActor
    
    MineActor "*" --> HW2Scene
    MineBehavior "1" --> MineActor
    
    LaserActor "*" --> HW2Scene
    LaserBehavior "1" --> LaserActor
    
    BubbleActor "*" --> HW2Scene
    BubbleBehavior "1" --> BubbleActor
```
HW2Scene is responsible for managing it's object pools, performing basic collision detection, moving the background, keeping track of the player's score, and updating the UI. Playing animations, handling collisions, and updating the state of our actors (player, mines, bubbles, lasers) is delegated to AI component of the actor. 

## Loading Assets
Loading assets into Wolfie2D is done through the ResourceManager class. All scenes have a field called `load` that maintains a reference to the ResourceManager. If you have a resource or asset that needs to be loaded in before starting a scene, you should use the ResourceManager to load in the asset in the `loadScene()` lifecycle method. 

For HW2, most of the assets for the game have been loaded in for you. You'll just need to load in your custom sprite from hw1 in place of my yellow barrel with windows and a parascope.

> The base Scene class has several lifecycle methods in addition to the `loadScene()` method. I recommend checking them out. The `HW2Scene` class uses almost all of them :wink:

## Playing Animations
For HW2, your player's sprite should respond to various game events by playing it's different animations. 

- If the player takes damage from any source (mine or suffocation) the player's sprite should play it's hurt animation, if it's not already playinng.
- While the player is moving, the player's sprite should play it's "MOVING" animation, if it's not already playing.
- While the player is not moving (idling) the player's sprite should play it's "IDLE" animation.
- When the player's health reaches 0, the player should play it's "DYING" animation. After the "DYING" animation has played, the player's sprite should play it's "DEAD" animation. Once the player is dead, the game should transition to the game over scene.

As for actually playing your sprites animations; All `AnimatedSprites` in Wolfie2D expose an AnimationManager that can be used to play animations associated with an animated sprite. 
```typescript
class AnimatedSprite {
    animation: AnimationManager     
}
```
If you want to know more about the different ways you can play animations using the animation manager, I recommend checking out the code in the AnimationManager class.

## Emitting and Receiving Events
The EventQueue is probably the most important piece of the Wolfie2D game engine. For hw2, you'll need to subscribe, handle, and emit events to and from the EventQueue to get the assignment working.

> If you're familiar with web development or you've take CSE-316, I handle events from the EventQueue very similarly to how a reducer in a global store handles updating state :wink:

## Screen Despawning

## Wrapping and Locking
When the player moves halfway off the top or bottom of the screen, the player's sprite should be "wrapped" around to the other side of the screen. For reference I have repurposed some old ascii art from last year's hw3. The o's represent locations where the player should be wrapped. The O's represent locations where the player should be wrapped to. The X's represent locations where the player shouldn't be wrapped.

Ex. the player should be wrapped from o1 -> O1, from o2 -> O2, etc.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
In addition to the player wrapping along the top and bottom of the screen, the player should not be able to move off the left or right side of the screen. More specifically, the left edge of the player's sprite should not move beyond the left edge of the viewport and the right side of the player's sprite should not move outside the right edge of the viewport.

For reference, here's some more ascii art repurpsoed from an old assignment. The o's represent valid player locations and the X's represent invalid player locations.

## Interfacing with the Playback System
Wolfie2D supports a basic replay system you can use to replay your games. For the most part, the playback system exists in it's own little bubble. There are three events you can use to interact with the existing playback system (shown below).

```typescript
enum GameEventType {
  /**
	 * Start Recording event. Has data: {recording: Recording}
	 */
	START_RECORDING = "start_recording",

	/**
	 * Stop Recording event. Has data: {}
	 */
	STOP_RECORDING = "stop_recording",
	
	/**
	 * Play Recording event. Has data: {}
	 */
	PLAY_RECORDING = "play_recording",
}
```


A couple of notes about recording things:
1. You'll need to make sure to save/keep track of the random seed for your recorded scene. When you go to replay your games, it should be pretty obvious if the random seed was not set correctly.
2. Make sure you have some way to detect whether or not you should record the HW2Scene or not. The playback system does not support recordings of recordings.

## Shaders and WebGL

## Bugs
Where there's code, there's bugs. If you guys think you've run into a bug in the assignments, feel free to reach out to me on piazza, at my office hours, or on discord. 

## Known Issues 
After switching to the HW2Scene for the third time, it looks like the webgl rendering system starts to "break down" for lack of a better word. This issue has there for awhile. I suspect it's an issue buried in the resource manager. As a work-around, you can just refresh the browser. 

Here's what the HW2Scene looks like when I switch to it for the third time:
